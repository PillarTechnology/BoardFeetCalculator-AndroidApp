I am starting the process of adding Continuous Integration support for the project.

This will initially be a 'todo' list for me in order to keep track of required steps and 
a running list of notes.

1. setup required environment within Cloudbees... including the Android simulator for CI
2. create service hook within GIT in order to trigger CI after a commit
3. setup Jenkins job to compile/run tests on new code checkin... only pushing to 'PROD' after a successful compile/test phase
4. etc.
